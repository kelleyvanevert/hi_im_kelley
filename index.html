<h1>Hi! I'm Kelley</h1>

<p>
  I'll be one of your teachers this academy, and look forward
  to meeting you! <br /> Here's a picture of me:

<h2>Personal info</h2>
<p>
  "Just went through university" &mdash; I'm lucky to have followed
  a fascinating master's program called <em>Mathematical Foundations of
  Computer Science</em>. We'll actually be covering some of the topics
  I studied about in the Codaisseur academy, and I'm especially enthusiastic
  about teaching these to you! (Type theory, execution semantics,
  functional programming, the historical declarative tendency of
  programming languages, etc.)
</p>
<p>
  My name (which is usually used for women), and my town of birth
  (Moscow, the one in Idaho, US, not the one in Russia) are the
  two points people often find confusing :)
</p>

<h2>Hobbies &amp; fascinations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I like climbing mountains</li>
  <li>I like debugging</li>
  <li>
    I like listening to Avishai Cohen (the bassist, not the trumpeter),
    Sia (especially her older work), and used to listen to a lot of metal
    (primarily Meshuggah and Opeth)
  </li>
  <li>
    I like thinking about (certain) philosophy and linguistic semantics.
  </li>
  <li>I like reading/watching sci fi (J G Ballard, Mark Faber)</li>

</ul>
